# Frontend Homework Assignment

## Preface

At Vinted, frontend developers take part in the design process, so they are knowledgeable not only in latest HTML, CSS or Javascript things but also tools, which are used in UI design. We strive for composable, maintainable, testable and UX-aware systems.

## Assignment

Based on the provided screenshots, make a simple `infinite-scroll` capable web application that allows for the user to browse items and favourite them.

### Requirements
* You are to use [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/) (recommended) or a similar API for data retrieval. If you choose another API, make sure it supports paginated results, unique images with some metadata and a way for us to access it. Please include (in the repository) an API key so that we can test the app.
* Design should be recreated as closely as possible, including item hover state.
* Responsive design (with at least three breakpoints — Desktop, Tablet, Phone).
* Infinite scroll - it's a concept where additional data is loaded when user scrolls down the screen.
* A possibility to favourite an item (favourites should not be lost on page reload).
* Tests. We write a lot of tests and we'd love to see them. Don't get discouraged if you have no experience in writing tests, though. That's not a prerequisite to submit the homework assignment.
* Static typing. We prefer TypeScript. However, that's only one non-crucial criteria and we'd rather see good JavaScript code than bad TypeScript code.
* Sufficient documentation (instructions how to run the code and everything else that you'd see value in documenting in real world)
* It is preferred to use `React`, but you can write vanilla JS code as well (no other libraries/frameworks, though).
* You are only allowed to use `react`, `react-dom` and your choice of any development-environment specific libraries (testing tools, babel, etc). All other 3rd-party libraries are forbidden (`react-router`, `Redux`, `lodash`, `jQuery`, `axios`, `bootstrap`, etc).
* For styling you can choose a solution that you think works best, such as regular CSS/SCSS, `CSS modules`, `Styled Components`, etc. However, you are not allowed to use styling and UI frameworks such as `bootstrap`, `material-ui`, `tailwind` and similar. We want the code to be your own.
* Lazy-loading images.
* A responsive image solution (Save traffic by loading higher quality images only when it’s needed).

### Tips
* To save time, work on the fundamentals first (API integration, infinite scrolling, favouriting) and polish things later.
* If you are short on time, consider using web app boilerplates that prepare code bundling, packaging for you.
* Please be mindful that the more you depend on copy-pasted code from the Internet, the harder it is for us to evaluate you objectively.
* Make sure your project has everything needed for us to run and evaluate it on our machines.
* Great developers use great tools. Don’t be afraid to show what development tools you use (CSS pre-processors, Javascript task-runners, testing libraries, etc.)
* We're saying a big **YES** to the usage of cutting-edge technologies available in modern browsers.
* We haven’t included a Photoshop, Sketch or any other design tool source file for a reason. We believe that pixel-perfect implementation can only be achieved by understanding the design process and not by reading specifications available in source files.
* If you are not happy with your solution and don't have time to rework it, but still want to deliver on your commitment and send it to us, write down your ideas, better solutions, alternatives. We may take that into account when evaluating your work! :)

### Bonus

If you have time, you can work on additional functionality for your app. It is a great way to showcase more of your skills! However, we *highly suggest* working on these only if the required functionality is implemented and you are confident with your solution. :)

We understand that the main requirements are already a lot and they are already sufficient to showcase your skills.
